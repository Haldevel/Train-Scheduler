# Train-Scheduler
### by Halina Z
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The web app uses Firebase to write the data inserted by a user into an html form. The app retrieves the data and dynamically generates an html table for the data stored in the database. The data models a train scheduler, with the various trains data such as their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
